#+TITLE: Wire Cell Interface to TBB flow graph

Note, TBB docs seem to be under constant churn so expect links here to become dead.

* Nodes

[[https://spec.oneapi.io/versions/latest/elements/oneTBB/source/flow_graph.html#nodes][TBB nodes used]]:

- =source_node= :: takes body object, activation
- =function_node= :: takes body object, concurrency limit, buffered input by default.
- =multifunction_node= ::  templated, =typedef= on in/out types.  Out is a =tbb::flow::tuple= which is a =std::tuple=, takes a body which is given a collection of output ports into which it may put actual output.
- =composite_node= ::  N-to-M external ports encapsulating a sub-graph of internal nodes
- =join_node= :: queued input (by default), sends tuple
- ~split_node~ :: part of fanout

* Policy

TBB ~flow_graph~ nodes follow policies as to their [[https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/tbb-documentation/top/intel-threading-building-blocks-developer-reference/flow-graph/overview/fowarding-buffering-and-reception-policy.html][fowarding, buffering and reception]].

Forwarding:

- broadcast-push :: the message will be pushed to as many successors
  as will accept the message. If no successor accepts the message, the
  fate of the message depends on the output *buffering* policy of the
  node.

- single-push :: if the message is accepted by a successor, no further
  push of that message will occur.  This policy is unique to
  buffer_node, queue_node, priority_queue_node and sequencer_node. If
  no successor accepts the message, it will be retained for a possible
  future push or pull.

Buffering:

- buffering :: if no successor accepts a message, it is stored so
  subsequent node processing can use it. Nodes that buffer outputs
  have "yes" in the column "try_get()?" below.

- discarding :: if no successor accepts a message, it is discarded and
  has no further effect on graph execution. Nodes that discard outputs
  have "no" in the column "try_get()?" below.

Reception

- accept :: the node will deal with as many messages as are pushed to
  it.

- switch :: the message is not accepted, and the the state of the edge
  will change from push to pull mode.

There is then a table that summarizes the policies for each node.

* Understanding the policy

How to make sense of the policies, in part, requires to understand the
TBB [[https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/tbb-documentation/top/intel-threading-building-blocks-developer-guide/parallelizing-data-flow-and-dependence-graphs/basic-flow-graph-concepts/message-passing-protocol.html][Message Passing Protocol]].  The link explains well the idea of an
edge being in either "push" or "pull" mode.  When in "push" the sender
tries to "put" and if that fails the mode is set to "pull".  When in
"pull" the receiver tries to "get" and if that fails the mode is set
to "push".

But, a change of mode is subject to the *buffering policy*.  If a
preceding node with:

- forwarding = broadcast-push
- buffering = discarding (~try_get()~ = no)

shares an edge with a successor node  with

- reception = switch

data may be dropped.  This will occur if the *preceding node* is any of:

- ~function_node~
- ~multifunction_node~
- ~split_node~

and the *succeeding node* is any of

- ~function_node<rejecting>~
- ~multifunction_node<rejecting>~

Where the ~<rejecting>~ is a non-default template argument for function
nodes.  The default ~<queueing>~ argument allows the function nodes have
[[https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/tbb-documentation/top/intel-threading-building-blocks-developer-reference/flow-graph/functional-nodes/functionnode-template-class.html][infinite input FIFO buffer]].  A consequence of using ~<queueing>~ is that
RAM usage may grow without bound.

* Out-of-order

The [[https://spec.oneapi.io/versions/latest/elements/oneTBB/source/flow_graph/split_node_cls.html][TBB ~split_node~ ]] is used in part to execute WCT's ~IFanout~ nodes.
It trails a ~function_node~ with a WCT body which is responsible to
produce a tuple that is passed to the ~split_node~ to send each tuple
element out a corresponding port.  The ~split_node~ has *discarding* and
*broadcast-push* policy and it also has *unlimited concurrency*.  This
concurrency means that ~split_node~ is a source of potentially
out-of-order (OOO) data.  To correct that, following each ~split_node~
output port is a ~sequencer_node~ which reorders based on a sequence
number added by the original ~function_node~ calling the WCT fanout
function body.  Because this seqno violates the WCT data model, a
final ~function_node~ follows each ~sequencer_node~ which strips off the
seqno.  So, each N-way fanout is really a 2*(N+1) subgraph.
