/** 

    A blob is a region in the 2D plane transverse to the drift
    direction.  It is made up of a number of logically coplanar
    "layers".  Each layer is bound by a pair of parallel rays.  Rays
    may correspond to wires or to overall bounds of senitivity of the
    anode plane face.  See manual for details.


    A blob is assumed to exist in some context which provides its
    location along a drift direction aka time and a logical assocation
    with a particular anode face.  See IBlobSet for example.
