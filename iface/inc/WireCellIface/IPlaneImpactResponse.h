/** A plane impact response provides information about a collection of
 * impact responses for a plane.  An impact response is a complex
 * Fourier spectrum of some response (eg, field and possibly also
 * electronics) to a point charge on a drift path that starts at the
 * given impact position.  Impact positions provide a regular
 * subdivision along the pitch direction for a wire plane.  Typically
 * ten impact positions per wire region are used and with one impact
 * position exactly aligned to a wire position.
